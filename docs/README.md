# Prime Frontend Quickstart docs

A simple project that uses PrimeVue on the frontend, without using Node or a build step.

Just an HTML page and a JS file which gets loaded on the frontend. Using [ES Modules][] here means libraries are loaded in JS using `import` syntax instead of with `src` tags in HTML.

[ES Modules]: https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/javascript/general/modules/es-modules.html

If you want a multi-page site, add Vue Router or use multiple HTML pages or Jekyll templating.

If you want the dev tooling (for linting, minification and using `.vue` files) or have a large site, then a traditional Node and NPM approach to Vue might suit you better.
