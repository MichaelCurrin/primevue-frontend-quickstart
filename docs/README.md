# Prime Frontend Quickstart docs

A simple project that uses PrimeVue on the frontend, without using Node or a build step.

Just an HTML page and a JS file which gets loaded on the frontend. Using [ES Modules][] here means libraries are loaded in JS using `import` syntax instead of with `src` tags in HTML.

[ES Modules]: https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/javascript/general/modules/es-modules.html

If you want a multi-page site, add Vue Router or use multiple HTML pages or Jekyll templating.

If you want the dev tooling (for linting, minification and using `.vue` files) or have a large site, then a traditional Node and NPM approach to Vue might suit you better.

See Vue quickstart below and follow the steps on the PrimeVue site's Quickstart guide to add PrimeVue to your site.
