# Prime Frontend Quickstart docs

A simple project that uses PrimeVue on the frontend, without using Node or a build or compile step.

This is a template project which you can easily copy to your own repos.

The Vue app is handled with one HTML page and a JS file which gets loaded on the frontend. Using [ES Modules][] here means libraries are loaded in JS using `import` syntax instead of with `src` tags in HTML.

To set up PrimeVue for a Node app instead:

- See the official quickstart project, with Vue and PrimeVue already integrated.
